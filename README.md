Advanced Flight Database Design â€“ SQL Server + PowerDesigner
As part of my coursework in advanced database technologies, I designed and implemented a fully structured relational database system for managing flight data.

The project involved:

Analyzing functional and data requirements for the flight domain,
Designing a conceptual data model using PowerDesigner with entities, attributes, and relationships,
Generating a physical database model and creating SQL scripts to build the structure in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS),
Populating the database with example data and performing advanced SQL queries (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, ORDER BY).
The database was designed with scalability and real-world application in mind...
